# Stretch: Spring App PWS Deployment

The purpose of this activity is to have you gain experience in deploying an existing Spring Boot application to PWS. This activity will also give you experience with cloning, configuring, and running third-party Spring Boot project using that team's directions. This will be similar to what you have done before but will differ slightly, giving you an opportunity to see how another team approaches things. The ability to read, follow, and complete third part directions is a critical developer skill.

This is a stretch activity because the directions will ask you to do things you have already done in a different way and will ask you to do things that you've haven't done yet.

You will need:

* Internet connection
* Browser
* Terminal/command prompt
* PWS account
* Locally installed PWS CLI tools
* Locally installed MySQL database
* Locally installed Maven
  * Note: the instructions only give guidance for Mac users with Homebrew installed. Maven installation instruction for other configurations can be found here: http://maven.apache.org/install.html.
  * You will be asked to set some Environment Variables, which may be something you've never done before. There are directions here but they are sparse - try them out and ask questions!

## Directions

Go to https://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/java/getting-started-deploying-apps/gsg-spring.html and follow the directions for deploying the existing Spring Boot application.

The directions suggest that you should make sure the application runs locally before you deploy to PWS. The directions for deploying locally are in the README.md of the GitHub repository for the application:

https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/pong_matcher_spring

Get the application running locally and then deploy the application to PWS.
